Generate classes for a camera object which handles the recording etc, but has public access for the current frame so we can update our main IMageViews on the application

Features:

    - ExpandableViews that change in size dynamically (drag to expand like gyfcat maybe?)
    - Current bitrate (12fps @ 640x480) 24hrs = 15gb of video using Codec 66
